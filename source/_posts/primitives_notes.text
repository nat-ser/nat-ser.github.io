//data types
//primitives
Numbers, string, booleans, Symbols, undefined and null
//objects

///main differences
mutability-ability to add and remove properties.
comparison- value vs reference

///wrapper objects
- allow to call method on a primitives
- temporarily change the Primitive to an Objectâ€”allowing you to use the length method to mutate it. This temporary Object is called a Wrapper Object.


each object has a unique identity and is only (strictly) equal to itself:



"abc".length
 In this case the string value is coerced to a string object in order to access the property length. The string object is only used for a fraction of second after which it is sacrificed to the Gods of garbage collection
